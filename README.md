 Top five new desirable functionlities that I have not seen before in any other apps:
1. Muting Images (Any type of image)
2. The feature to translate text to any language of my liking
3. The feature to download any posted video
4. The feature in which you speak on the microphone and the app will generate text for you therefore (no need to type when texting people)
5. A feauture which scans the user's face to determine wether they are at the appropirate age to use the app
